As the British enslave India with their devious Divide and Rule policy, kings and nawabs fall to their guile and cunning ways, and entrust their precious kingdom to the foreigners. Except, however, for the brave Pindaris, who prefer death to dishonour and will fight till their last breath to save their motherland. The bravest, toughest and strongest of the Pindaris is Veer. As Veer takes on the might of the British Empire, he also has to fight the conniving King of Madavgarh, along with his own jealous tribesmen. But then the stakes are high. At stake is his love for princess Yashodhara, daughter of his sworn enemy, and his thirst to avenge his father's dishonour. His own existence itself is at stake as cannons roar, swords clash in the fierce battlefields and the dead pile up. But when the dust settles down on the blood soaked land, only one valiant warrior stands head and shoulders above them all - Veer! Watch this epic saga of bravery, drama, treachery and love.",
